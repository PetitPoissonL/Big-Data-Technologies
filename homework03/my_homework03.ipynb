    "# New York taxis trips\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is about New York taxi trips. Here is something from [Todd Schneider](https://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission has released a  detailed historical dataset covering over 1 billion individual taxi trips in the city from January 2009 through December 2019. \n",
    "Taken as a whole, the detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates: it's a story of a City. \n",
    "How bad is the rush hour traffic from Midtown to JFK? \n",
    "Where does the Bridge and Tunnel crowd hang out on Saturday nights?\n",
    "What time do investment bankers get to work? How has Uber changed the landscape for taxis?\n",
    "The dataset addresses all of these questions and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NY taxi trips dataset has been plowed by series of distinguished data scientists.\n",
    "The dataset is available from on Amazon S3 (Amazon's cloud storage service).\n",
    "The link for each file has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_{year}-{month}.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one CSV file for each NY taxi service (`yellow`, `green`, `fhv`) and each calendar month (replacing `{year}` and `{month}` by the desired ones).\n",
    "Each file is moderately large, a few gigabytes. \n",
    "The full dataset is relatively large if it has to be handled on a laptop (several hundred gigabytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will focus on the `yellow` taxi service and a pair of months, from year 2015 and from year 2018. \n",
    "Between those two years, for hire vehicles services have taken off and carved a huge marketshare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever the framework you use, `CSV` files prove hard to handle. \n",
    "After downloading the appropriate files (this takes time, but this is routine), a first step will consist in converting the csv files into a more Spark friendly format such as `parquet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving into one of those formats require decisions about bucketing, partitioning and so on. Such decisions influence performance. It is your call.\n",
    "Many people have been working on this dataset, to cite but a few:\n",
